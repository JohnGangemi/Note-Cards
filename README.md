# Note-Cards

Only my second project using Windows Forms framework. I Used it to study for courses while attending the University of South Florida. By the way it's oooooold, so there may be some compatibility issues.

###Notes
- It only runs on Windows OS.
- Initial run of application will create a new folder in your "My Documents" path

###Requirements
The program requires local storage in your "My Documents" folder. The target folder will be named, "Digital Flash Cards".
